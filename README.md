# Project "Virtual Store"

This project consists of a simple virtual store, developed as a way of learning web programming. The store allows users to view products available for purchase and add to the shopping cart.

When clicking on the "buy" button, if the product is available, the user will be redirected to a purchase confirmation page. Otherwise, an alert will be displayed informing that the product is out of stock and that the user must wait for 2 days.
